<h2>What I have been working on</h2>

<p>I have been working different projects ever science coning to the brooklyn steam center, mostly working with computers in both programming and cyber security which were fun with one of these projects being this respository.</p>
<img src="images/Project.jpg" width="600">
<p>This project is one I did during a cyber security class of a map of a private doctor's offace where I had to find spots for any devices or ways of hardening (ways of securing something) like cameras, locks, ID cards, desktops, tablets, and buzzers.</p>

<img src="images/Patent.png" width="600">
<p>This is a group project I had to do with 3 other students where we had to think of a business idea and make a website based off of the idea we had. my group and I came up with Patent Works, an industry which can theach you about patents and be a cost effective scource to test your ideas for a good price. If your intrested the URL is https://patent-works.cyberbyte.cc</p>
