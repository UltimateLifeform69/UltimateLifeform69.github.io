<p>As I stated in my about me I am a big fan of video games and my favorate video game character is sonic the hedgehog. </p>
<div class="text-center"><img src="images/sonic.jpg" width="300"></div>
<p>I loved all of the sonic games i've played from the 2d to the 3d sonic games and even enjoyed the games that people say were bad like both sonic and the black knight and sonic and the secret rings which are highly contrivertial amoung the community. The first sonic game I've ever played was sonic CD on my mother's phone inside her car on the way to church. </p>
